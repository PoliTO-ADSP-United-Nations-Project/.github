# Time-Series Forecasting for Humanitarian Aid
Big Data hold huge potential for humanitarian organisations, to improve their early warning systems and generate better contingency planning figures. It can provide granular, and almost real-time information in locations where there are few othere data sources.

## Project Description

## Achievements
- The creation of a novel Dataset suitable for further researches and analysis;
- A transformer-based deep learning benchmark for time-series forecasting;
- A detailed report, to help future learners to understand and replicate our model and findings.

The project was proposed as part of the [Applied Data Science Project](https://github.com/adsp-polito/adsp-polito.github.io) course, in collaboration with United Nations and the UNSSC. It comes as part of the Polytechnic of Turin's [Data Science and Engineering](https://didattica.polito.it/laurea_magistrale/data_science/en/home) Master Degree.
