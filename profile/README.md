# Time-Series Forecasting for Humanitarian Aid
Big Data hold huge potential for humanitarian organisations, to improve their early warning systems and generate better contingency planning figures. It can provide granular, and almost real-time information in locations where there are few othere data sources.

## Project Description:
Predicting migratory flows is crucial in managing humanitarian aid and determining the appropriate size of refugee camps. However, this forecast is challenging due to the numerous and complex factors such as politics, climate, social and economic issues. To tackle this issue, data-driven approaches are necessary. 

Despite advancements in collecting migration data and improving data collection methods, most data sources still lack sufficient frequency, definitions, coverage, accuracy, and quality assurance, particularly in terms of data on migration drivers like conflicts, human rights, and the economy. Effective forecasting requires high-quality data with accurate, timely and frequent information.

To achieve this goal, we took the state-of-the-art in time-series forecasting, and compared it to the latest deep learning models using transformers.

## Achievements:
- The creation of a novel Dataset suitable for further researches and analysis;
- A transformer-based deep learning benchmark for time-series forecasting;
- A detailed report, to help future learners to understand and replicate our model and findings.

The project responds directly to SDG 10 - Reduced Inequality, SDG 13 - Climate Action, SDG 16 - Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, and  SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals. Moreover, it also address the need identified by UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, in his recently launched SG Data Strategy, about making better use of data – with approaches grounded in UN values and human rights – as integral to the UN future and service.
