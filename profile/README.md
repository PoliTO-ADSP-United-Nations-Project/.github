# Time-Series Forecasting for Humanitarian Aid
Big Data hold huge potential for humanitarian organisations, to improve their early warning systems and generate better contingency planning figures. It can provide granular, and almost real-time information in locations where there are few othere data sources.

## Project Description:
The growing climate crisis, the increasingly recurring exceptional climatic events, and the consequent humanitarian crises that arise from them, have drawn attention to a very particular question: is there a link between extreme climatic events and migratory flows?

The present work has the primary objective of predicting immigration inflows from different countries of origin, located in Africa and Middle-east. The prediction tries to take into account aspects related to climate change that can influence migratory flows. In addition, the constructed model takes into consideration further information deriving from social indices, humanitarian crises, etc.

To achieve this goal, we took the state-of-the-art in time-series forecasting, and compared it to the latest deep learning models using transformers.

## Achievements:
- The creation of a novel Dataset suitable for further researches and analysis;
- A transformer-based deep learning benchmark for time-series forecasting;
- A detailed report, to help future learners to understand and replicate our model and findings.

The project responds directly to SDG 10 - Reduced Inequality, SDG 13 - Climate Action, SDG 16 - Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, and  SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals. Moreover, it also address the need identified by UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, in his recently launched SG Data Strategy, about making better use of data – with approaches grounded in UN values and human rights – as integral to the UN future and service.


This repository is divided as follows:
- `Code`
- `Dataset`

The project was proposed as part of the [Applied Data Science Project](https://github.com/adsp-polito/adsp-polito.github.io) course, in collaboration with United Nations and the UNSSC. It comes as part of the Polytechnic of Turin's [Data Science and Engineering](https://didattica.polito.it/laurea_magistrale/data_science/en/home) Master Degree.
